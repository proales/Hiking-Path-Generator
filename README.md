Hiking Path Generator
=====================

A Java program to generate optimal hiking paths through open backcountry using GIS data.

When you click on a point on the GIS map, a hiking path from east to west is generated that follows the lowest elevation curve. Rath line shows green for when you are decending, red for ascending.
